      <p>Hi Jewel!</span></p>
<div class='row'>
    <div class='col'>
<p> I am writing to see if you could help me with an engagement proposal.</span></p>
<p>My partner Amy is an Emergency Room doctor in Brooklyn where Covid-19 hit the hardest.  She works at an inner city hospital and there were times where she would come home crying because she had called over 20 Timeâ€™s of death in a single night.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> She deserves an incredible proposal, so I am trying to combine some of her favorite things &ndash; Adventure sports, scavenger hunts, and actors from her favorite shows (Firefly is a BIG one).</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" >I put together a scavenger hunt that has us start in Brooklyn and end in Hilton Head where I will do the proposal, it will escalate from simple clues to races against time on Jet Ski&rsquo;s. The theme is that we are helping the CIA solve a symbol. And the puzzles help them do it.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" >The last puzzle will lead us to the deck where I will do the proposal and give a speech about how I wanted to start the marriage off with an adventure because that is the kind of marriage I want to have with her.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" >So that&rsquo;s the background.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" >Of all the people on this site you would be her favorite, so I was hoping I could pay you to do two video clues, the very first one and the very last one. It doesn&rsquo;t need to be anything fancy but if you could pretend to be a CIA agent and read the script for the clue it would be so huge for giving her the best proposal ever.</span></p>

<p >Amy, Richie, My name is agent Fleming. The two of you received a letter today with a test, a test you passed. This means we need your help.</span></p>
<p> Two days ago, after an experiment, a CERN scientist became neurotic. He started drawing this Glyph and claiming with it he could predict the future. &nbsp;Testing showed he could indeed predict future events.</span></p>
<p></p>We need to understand this Glyph, and we have chosen the two of you. &nbsp;When pressed for information, the scientist gave us a puzzle that he insisted &ldquo;would lead us to the truth&rdquo; We would like your assistance in solving the puzzle while our experts continue to work on the symbol.</span></p>
<p>The puzzle has been delivered to your address. &nbsp;When you have the solution send us a message.</span></p>
<p><br></p>

<div class='row'>
<p><b>Last Clue</b></span></p>
<p>We have the upload and we&rsquo;ve cracked the glyph. &nbsp;It appears to show whoever looks at it, &nbsp;their future. &nbsp;Why don&rsquo;t you take a look. &nbsp;You both have done great, why don&rsquo;t you get cleaned up, Amy I think there might be a special dinner for you. (wink). &nbsp;Well done you two.</span></p>
