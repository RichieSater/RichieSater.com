      <p>Hi Wilf!</span></p>
<div class='row'>
    <div class='col'>
<p> I am writing to see if you could help me with an engagement proposal.</span></p>
<p>My partner Amy is an Emergency Room doctor in Brooklyn where Covid-19 hit the hardest.  She works at an inner city hospital and there were times where she would come home crying because she had called over 20 Timeâ€™s of death in a single night.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> She deserves an incredible proposal, so I am trying to combine some of her favorite things &ndash; Adventure sports, scavenger hunts, and actors from her favorite shows (GOT is a BIG one).</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" >I put together a scavenger hunt that has us start in Brooklyn and end in Hilton Head where I will do the proposal, it will escalate from simple clues to races against time on Jet Ski&rsquo;s. The theme is that we are helping the CIA solve a symbol. And the puzzles help them do it.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" >The last puzzle will lead us to the deck where I will do the proposal and give a speech about how I wanted to start the marriage off with an adventure because that is the kind of marriage I want to have with her.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" >So that&rsquo;s the background.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" >Since she is a HUGE fan (I am too) I was hoping I could pay you to do a video clue. It doesn&rsquo;t need to be anything fancy but if you could pretend to be a CIA agent and read the script for the clue it would be so huge for giving her the best proposal ever.</span></p>

      <h1>Script For Video</h1>
      <p dir="ltr" >Amy, Richie, Welcome to Georgia. &nbsp;This is Agent Thompson and I am here to inform you that while you were in the air the situation has grown complicated. The good news, we have almost solved the final puzzle. all we need is what&rsquo;s on that flash drive. &nbsp;The bad news, the agent we told you about has &nbsp;disappeared. &nbsp;</p>
<p><br></p>
<p dir="ltr" >We are sending you to his last known location. Be warned, we aren&rsquo;t the only government looking into this. &nbsp;Enemy agents are in play. &nbsp;Watch your back you two, and good luck. &nbsp;We will send an eye in the sky if we can.</p>
