      <p>Hi Robert!</span></p>
<div class='row'>
    <div class='col'>
<p> I am writing to see if you could help me with an engagement proposal.</span></p>
<p>My partner Amy is an Emergency Room doctor in Brooklyn where Covid-19 hit the hardest.  She works at an inner city hospital and there were times where she would come home crying because she had called over 20 Timeâ€™s of death in a single night.</p>
<p dir="ltr"> She deserves an incredible proposal, so I am trying to combine some of her favorite things &ndash; Adventure sports, scavenger hunts, and actors from her favorite shows (Grey's is a BIG one).</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" >I put together a scavenger hunt that has us start in Brooklyn and end in Hilton Head where I will do the proposal, it will escalate from simple clues to races against time on Jet Ski&rsquo;s. The theme is that we are helping the CIA solve a symbol. And the puzzles help them do it.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" >The last puzzle will lead us to the deck where I will do the proposal and give a speech about how I wanted to start the marriage off with an adventure because that is the kind of marriage I want to have with her.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" >So that&rsquo;s the background.</span></p>
<p dir="ltr" >Of all the people on this site you would be her favorite, so I was hoping I could pay you to do a video clue. It doesn&rsquo;t need to be anything fancy but if you could pretend to be a CIA agent and read the script for the clue it would be so huge for giving her the best proposal ever.</span></p>

      <p dir="ltr" >While you travel, our team has discovered three more puzzles linked to the three points on top the glyph. &nbsp;We have deciphered clues for the first two.</p>
      <p dir="ltr" >We will send you the details. &nbsp;Get to Hilton Head Island. &nbsp;There is an Agent there preparing a flash drive with everything you need to finish this. We will be in touch. &nbsp;</p>
